# First Game Idea ##
### 2d platformer
    1. **main goal needed**
    2. needs map editor
    3. rendering by rooms
    4. dungeons with diferent biomes
    
## top down minigames
    - for example lock picking
    - specific fights dunno, needs ideas

## The way of work

>**Make everything good before moving on, repairs later are a pain in the ass**
    
    1. drawing map, character, sprites, textures
    
    2. movement (no gravity and nothing just to get inputs)
    
    3. on a basic map:

        - try gravity, environmental effects
        
        - hp, fall damage
        
        - enemies 
        
        - attacks, movement, animations 
        
        - others that should be tested and implemented before moving on to map generator and making map loading available
    
    4. map things

    5. saving and such, will think about later

# Game idea 2:
